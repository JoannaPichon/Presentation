<h1> Hi, I'm Joanna,</h1>
ğŸ‘‹ Web developer, 21yo. <br/>
ğŸŒ± Actually, Im studying web development at Nice (GRETA). <br/>
ğŸ˜ƒ I love coding, debugging, solve problems, play logics puzzles. <br/>
ğŸ’¡ When I have an idea for a project, I like to think and find how to do my idea alone. <br/>
ğŸ”¥ I like when my brain is on fire to find the solution without any tutorial. <br/>
